# ðŸŒ¿ Nature's Platter - Grocery E-Commerce Frontend

**Nature's Platter** is a simple, fully responsive grocery e-commerce homepage built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This is my first project after learning the basics of Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- Tailwind CSS (CDN version)

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Clean and modern UI  
- Mobile-first responsive layout  
- Reusable product card sections  
- Promotional banners and CTA sections  
- Custom color palette and typography


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Just open the `index.html` file in any modern browser to view the project.

## ðŸ“Œ Note

This is a frontend-only static layout. No frameworks or interactivity yet â€“ just practice with layout and styling using Tailwind CSS.
